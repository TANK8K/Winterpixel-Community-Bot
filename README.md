# Winterpixel-Community-Bot
 A discord bot for winterpixel games discord made by the community (This bot is not officially made by Winterpixel)

## Requirements:
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies. Currently I am using Rapptz discord.py rewrite beta 2.0 so this will NOT work with the most recent official release of discord.py as of April 2022

## Usage: 

Join the discord to use the bot!

**If you're trying to make your own bot I'm sure you can figure it out. It should be pretty easy if you know what you're doing. rocketbot_client.py will sure to come in handy.**
